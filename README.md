Good Loan Total Received Amount <br />

#### Bad Loan: 
Bad Loan Application Percentage <br />

### Loan Status Grid View
In order to gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations and monitor the performance of loans, we aim to create a grid view report categorized by 'Loan Status.’ By providing insights into metrics such as 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received,' 'Month-to-Date (MTD) Funded Amount,' 'MTD Amount Received,' 'Average Interest Rate,' and 'Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI),' this grid view will empower us to make data-driven decisions and assess the health of our loan portfolio.

## DASHBOARD 2: OVERVIEW
### CHARTS
(1) Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):  To identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities. <br />
(2) Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map): To identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional disparities. <br />
(3) Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart): To allow the client to understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths.<br />
(4) Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart): How lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths, helping us assess the impact of employment history on loan applications.<br />
(5) Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart): Will provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes of loans, aiding in the understanding of the primary reasons borrowers seek financing.<br />
(6) Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map): For a hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements.
